# Navigation Restructure Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem Solved
The original navigation had Testing Kits and Telehealth incorrectly placed in the "Additional Services" dropdown, which was confusing and buried important services.

### New Navigation Structure

#### Before:

  ├── Telehealth
  └── Corporate Events
- Booking
- Supplements & Test Kits
- New Patients
- Membership
- Our Team
- Events
- Gift Cards
- Compliance
- Contact
```

#### After:
```
- IV Therapy (dropdown)
  ├── IV Therapy Services
  └── Vitamin Injections
- Advanced Treatments (dropdown)
  ├── NAD+ & Peptides
  ├── Weight Management
  └── Sexual Wellness
- Telehealth (standalone link)
- Supplements & Tests (renamed for clarity)
- Booking
- Patient Resources (new dropdown)
  ├── New Patients
  ├── Membership

  └── Compliance

  ├── Corporate Services
  └── Special Events

```
